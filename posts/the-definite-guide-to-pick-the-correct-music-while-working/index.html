    <p>I only know few semi-god-concentration-giants who don&rsquo;t work with headphones, while being productive at their company&rsquo;s -usually noisy- office and I really admire them.</p>
<p>For the rest of us co-mortals, we need our headphones/earphones, to make it through. But have you ever thought, what should you listen to, at work? And I mean, in terms of best value regarding your current state.</p>
<p>Below are some hints, about how you should pick the sound that will entertain your ears. Of course, they are not a silver bullet. It is the outcome of my personal experience and tons of experimentations during the past years.</p>
<h2 id="but-first-what-equipment-should-i-use-to-listen">But first, what equipment should I use to listen?</h2>
<p>Thanks for asking. For starters, please, do not listen from your computer&rsquo;s speakers directly. <strong>No one gives a f*ck about your music taste and no one needs your help in order to entertain himself.</strong>
And now that we got this fact sorted, let&rsquo;s answer the question. :-)</p>
<p>You can use any pair of semi-high-quality headphones/earphones. Avoid buying very cheap ones, but if you don&rsquo;t have the budget, don&rsquo;t go to <a href="https://amzn.to/2PJG4Rc">ultra-quality-noise-canceling</a> ones, even though they will totally upgrade your hearing experience.</p>
<p>Personally, I use <a href="https://amzn.to/2wm6yiG">these</a> and I am very happy with their performance and level of sound quality, but I would love to try a portable and budget noise cancellation pair.</p>
<h2 id="inspect-your-mental-state-and-your-tasks-ahead">Inspect your mental state and your tasks ahead</h2>
<p>In order to decide what kind of sound will keep company to my ears, I first take an &ldquo;inside look&rdquo; on how I feel and what my task ahead is. There is a different kind of music to hear if you want to do &ldquo;shallow work&rdquo; and reply to your emails comparing to the one you would hear if you were designing the next Mars Rover(wink-wink Elon Musk).</p>
<p>Without further ado, let&rsquo;s start with the suggestions. All sound sources, are summed up in the last section of the article. I will focus on the most common cases, as the potential combinations are too many to fit in an article.</p>
<h2 id="mental-state-mommy-i-dont-want-to-go-to-school">Mental state: Mommy-I-dont-want-to-go-to-school</h2>
<h3 id="task-mentally-challenging">Task: <em>Mentally challenging</em>:</h3>
<p>Here is the Mars Rover case. My first choice would be beta/gamma <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)#Binaural_beats">binaural beats</a>. You can help yourself to enter the zone more easily and temporarily reduce any lack of motivation, if you use them.</p>
<p>It is not a magic wand(if you want to procrastinate by all means and at all costs, you will eventually procrastinate) but it has helped me, quite a few times, especially on cases like &ldquo;last day before my 10-day holidays&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You can find binaural beats everywhere, from YouTube and Spotify to mobile apps, but my favorite place is a sound generator called <a href="http://fractalpanda.com/">fractal panda</a>.</p>
<h3 id="task-not-trivial-but-i-have-done-it-a-lot-of-times">Task: <em>Not trivial, but I have done it a lot of times</em>:</h3>
<p>If you are a frontend developer, that would be to make a login and a registration form, from scratch. Or if you are Batman, to drive the Batmobile.</p>
<p>In this case, I would pick instrumental music, maybe from my favorite genre(that would be power metal). Why instrumental and not my favorite band, I hear you asking, my wonderful reader?</p>
<p><img src="/img/2018/08/batman.jpeg" alt="Easy, tiger"></p>
<p>The &ldquo;favorite band&rdquo; choice is great, but lyrics might distract you with higher probability than pure music. Up to you though, feel free to experiment a bit. If you really insist, try and put a couple of songs in a loop, so that your brain is not reacting to &lsquo;shiny-new-songs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lo-fi music(how about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ22pgaXog4?">freecodecamp radio</a>, ambient sounds like trains and rain (have you used <a href="https://www.ambient-mixer.com/">ambient mixer</a> and its great collection?) and classical music are good choices as well. As always, YouTube and Spotify, are our best friends.</p>
<h3 id="task-i-need-creativity-as-i-am-a-content-creator">Task: <em>I need creativity, as I am a content creator</em>:</h3>
<p>I encourage you to utilize the coffee-shop effect. As <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/barboakley">Barbara Oakley</a> would mention in her great MOOC <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift">Mindshift</a> working in a coffee shop would help you enable the diffuse mode of your brain.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t brag that it had helped me a lot, but I recognize not everyone is the same. Instead, I see that calm violin tracks are giving me a good shot of creativity, so I am tapping on them when I have the chance.</p>
<p>I also know that some people enjoy the <a href="https://www.noisli.com/fan-background-noise-for-working">sound of a fan</a> for that matter, although most of us find it annoying.</p>
<h3 id="task-chilling-and-reading">Task: <em>Chilling and reading</em>:</h3>
<p>Ah, that wonderful time of the day. Chilling time, to be precise. I think it goes without saying that you should pick your favorite band(s). Relaxing genres(like jazz), are a good fit, as well. Especially, if it is before bedtime.
Also, it is worth giving alpha/theta/delta binaural beats a chance.</p>
<p>Now about reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is reading for <strong>university/exams</strong> in general(or for an equally important purpose) consider monotonous sounds, without lyrics. My favorites are violin(yep, again) and train sounds accompanied by thunderstorms(not sure why maybe I get the illusion of bad weather and thus I find no reasons to procrastinate).</li>
<li>If it is <strong>casual reading</strong>, like reading your favorite novel, then my best bet would be nature sounds. Forest and creek sounds always bring me good memories and put me in a relevant mental state.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mental-state-bring-it-on">Mental state: Bring it on:</h2>
<p>Here things are easier.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2018/08/excited.jpg" alt="Oprah approves"></p>
<p>First of all, I would like to insist you to stay away from gamma binaural beats. You are already motivated you have a good amount of beta/gamma activity in your head, so under normal circumstances, there is no need to enforce it even more.</p>
<p>Binaurals are considered safe in general with no health side effects, but you might get mentally exhausted easily, in such case.</p>
<p>Otherwise, using the same path to choose your perfect music track, as in the unmotivated state, will work for most people. Though, my favorite choice here is to pick, a playlist from my favorite band and increase the volume(only a bit, because we only get one pair of ears).</p>
<p>I would stick to up beating tracks, as they help you feed your enthusiasm through music.</p>
<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That&rsquo;s all folks</h2>
<p>Thank you for reading this article. Let&rsquo;s start by giving our best work-company, music, the attention it deserves. Below you can find links to all the sources I mentioned above. As always, I would be more than happy to listen to your own &ldquo;music strategies&rdquo;.</p>
