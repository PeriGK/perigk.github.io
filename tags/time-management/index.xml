      <description>Oh dear, if I had a dime, every time(oh just made a rhime, twice :D) someone complained to me about the lack of time. Even if that guy is&amp;hellip;myself. Life is a bi..h, according to folk wisdom, but if it is &amp;ldquo;fair and square&amp;rdquo; with one thing it is time.
We all have 24h per day to achieve our goals, complete our personal and professional tasks, spend quality time with our family and friends, take care of our bodies and so much more.</description>
