      <description>I find podcasts extremely overrated. Yeap, I know this is an extremely selfish and biased opinion, especially given the popularity of this &amp;ldquo;means of entertainment&amp;rdquo;.
But on the other hand, most things that suck have traction. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall something that was super ugly and didn&amp;rsquo;t have fanatic and passionate friends.
I will try to explain my view.
Bad equipment Too many podcasts have bad equipment. I find it extremely disrespectful and annoying to hear only half of what is discussed, due to low quality microphones.</description>
