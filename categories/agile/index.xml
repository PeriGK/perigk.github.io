      <description>A few months ago, I got the Professional Scrum Master Certification (PSM I).
As this is a trending certification nowadays, because most companies operate in some kind of agile methodologies, I would share some tips that helped me get 98% on the first try.
I will provide a fast and a slow track.
I would urge you to lean more towards the slow track, as the fast track, most of the time, will give you just enough knowledge to pass the certification; but this is totally not enough to solve business day to day team problems with scrum, which is what a big part of what a scrum master does.</description>
