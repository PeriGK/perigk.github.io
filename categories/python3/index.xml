      <description>Partial functions are one of the most &amp;ldquo;terrifying concepts&amp;rdquo; I hear people talking about. Personally, I think the idea is fairly easy to grasp. That is, I will try to explain in a few paragraphs with python and help you escape the math labyrinth of &amp;ldquo;official documentation&amp;rdquo;.
What is a partial function Partial functions are a computer science concept where we can derive a function with x parameters to a function with fewer parameters and constant values set for the more limited function.</description>

      <description>Unless you are living in the Amazonian forest with no access to the Internet, there is literally no chance that you have not heard about the Deep Learning boom, of the last few years.
Training neural networks, that can make decisions, distinguish fake images or generate fake videos, in a relatively short time is becoming the norm.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t all have to be scary though. Sometimes you can just have fun with all that power.</description>

      <description>A comprehensive introduction to unit-testing and mocking with Python3 Unit testing is quickly becoming a must for all job adverts. There are a few people who donâ€™t like Test Driven Development(TDD), but at least they agree on the value, automation testing(not only unit tests) add to the overall code quality and to the debugging process.
By the time of writing, according to dice.com, TDD is enjoying increased popularity year after year.</description>
