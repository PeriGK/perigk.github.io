      <description>By the time of writing of this article everyone knows, the &amp;ldquo;technologies of the future&amp;rdquo; as listed from various mainstream media. And I agree with most of them. It is worth discussing a few not so obvious though. I expect my &amp;ldquo;predictions&amp;rdquo; to be fulfilled by 2030.
Please note that these are my personal views. The views are built according to my understanding of how technology (and society) evolves. I am by no means a psychic, so reality might prove me wrong.</description>
