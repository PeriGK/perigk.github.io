      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting the question of how to keep up with the trends of the field quite often.
So I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article 1) as an answer to any future questions towards me 2) as a cheat sheet because I am getting older and you never know :)
For ease of future reference, I will separate them in time-based categories. Those categories will indicate how often you need to check up on the resource.</description>

      <title>Oh Podcasts, Why Do You Have to Suck</title>

      <description>I find podcasts extremely overrated. Yeap, I know this is an extremely selfish and biased opinion, especially given the popularity of this &amp;ldquo;means of entertainment&amp;rdquo;.
But on the other hand, most things that suck have traction. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall something that was super ugly and didn&amp;rsquo;t have fanatic and passionate friends.
I will try to explain my view.
Bad equipment Too many podcasts have bad equipment. I find it extremely disrespectful and annoying to hear only half of what is discussed, due to low quality microphones.</description>
