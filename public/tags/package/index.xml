      <description>How being lazy, led me to publicize my first python package There is a common saying, in the software industry, which goes like:
 I want to hire a lazy developer because he will find the way to deal with difficult problems in the shortest and easiest manner.
 I wasn’t there the first time this was told, but rumors say that these words belong to Bill Gates.
I don’t know if Mr Gates would ever hire me(wink wink) but I have to admit that having that kind of laziness, has led me, from time to time, to create interesting and time saving libraries/scripts/workarounds.</description>
