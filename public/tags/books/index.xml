      <description>Disclaimer: At the time of starting to write this article, the next version of the book under review, has not been published yet. If you want to read the newest version, you can find it here
Many people don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to research for a book. I think such articles could help people, accelerate their (correct)decision.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to write this article. This is a quick and dense review of Django by example by Antonio Mele</description>

      <description>There are tons of great books out there and a gazillion articles recommending them. The purpose of this article is not to recommend them again; I am pretty certain, thatÂ all such lists are very easy to be found with a few Google searches and no one needs me to tell him, that Code Complete is a must-read.
Thus, I&amp;rsquo;m going to list some books that are not very&amp;hellip;popular, but they are totally worth reading.</description>
