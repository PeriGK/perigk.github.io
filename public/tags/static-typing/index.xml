      <description>Python is a wonderful dynamically typed language, but quite a few people consider this as its biggest disadvantage.
But why? Even though dynamically typed languages, remove the headache of writing &amp;ldquo;mundane&amp;rdquo; type declarations and make writing more pleasant and a little bit faster, this need is just delegated to the runtime environment of the language.
That means, that some bugs that could have been eliminated, almost immediately after they are introduced, they will now remain silent till the code is invoked, And you know when this is going to happen, right?</description>
