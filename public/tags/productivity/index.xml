      <description>I only know few semi-god-concentration-giants who don&amp;rsquo;t work with headphones, while being productive at their company&amp;rsquo;s -usually noisy- office and I really admire them.

We all have 24h per day to achieve our goals, complete our personal and professional tasks, spend quality time with our family and friends, take care of our bodies and so much more.</description>
